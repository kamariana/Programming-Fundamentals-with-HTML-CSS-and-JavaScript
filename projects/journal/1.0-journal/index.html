        This world is fundamentally designed to disappoint you, so do not build
        on it, because it is a bridge to the next.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a beautiful spring morning a few years ago our team was locked in a
        competitive ultimate Frisbee match. With a tied score and only a few
        minutes left in the game we were playing harder and faster than we had
        in any other game during the tournament.

      <p>
        We got possession and started to drive down the field. The next throw
        was low and fast. Covering half the field. Ben, our team captain and
        fastest player, ran and dove to catch the disc. A photo from that
        moment, captured by the tournament photographer, shows him completely
        horizontal, about to complete an incredible catch.
      </p>

      <p>
        An opposing player realized he misread the throw and didn't get low
        enough to make a play on the Frisbee. In a split second, unable to stop,
        he had to decide how to avoid a collision.
      </p>

      <p>
        He chose to jump. I’ll never forget the sound of his knee colliding with
        the side of Ben’s head.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Looking back
      </h2>

      <p>
        Imagine yourself three years ago. Where did you live? How was it there?
        Where do you work? What are your dreams? What are your struggles?
      </p>

      <p>
        Step into that time and become that person for a moment. From that
        place, now look forward. What do you think of your life now?
      </p>

      <p>
        One of three things will be true:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Life is better now.</li>
        <li>Life is the same now.</li>
        <li>Life is worse now.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Which is true for you? Hold that thought. Hold that emotion.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Looking back deeply
      </h3>

      <p>
        Imagine yourself, when you where not existing at all. You where not in
        this world yet. Where were you? What was you? Why do you think you are
        here? How long and what struggles other people (parents, family, friends
        etc) sacrifice up to where you are today?
      </p>

      <p>
        Step into that time and become that person for a moment. From that
        place, now look forward. What do you think of your life now?
      </p>

      <h2>
        Waking up
      </h2>

      <p>
        As we all converged on Ben I had no idea what to think. He didn't move.
        After about 30 seconds he began to wake up. After a couple minutes he
        could get up on his own power. Immediately he wanted to know if we could
        continue the game. We had a tournament to win after all.
      </p>

      <p>
        We escorted him to the side while the tournament organizers called the
        game as a tie since we were now out of time before the next round of
        games needed to start. It was still early and they’d figure out a way to
        make the brackets work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now it was our turn to make a decision: will Ben be fine or should he
        see a doctor?
      </p>

      <p>
        Remembering the sound of the collision I made the call that we’d take
        him in. In the car on the way to the doctor Ben said: "Whoah. I’m just
        now coming to… so what happened?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, we were playing ultimate Frisbee and you got hit in the head while
        diving for the Frisbee. We just want to get you checked out by a…
      </p>

      <p>
        I was mid-explanation when the scariest thing happened.
        <q>Whoah. I’m just now coming to… so what happened?</q>
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone in the car traded freaked out looks. He said the same thing, in
        exactly the same way. With no memory of the conversation we just had or
        how he got in the car.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Whoah. I’m just now coming to… so what happened?
        </p>
        <cite>Ben</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Every 20-30 seconds each sentence started exactly the same way. In order
        to not freak him out we engaged in the conversation. Telling the same
        story on repeat.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the front desk he knew all his information and was able to answer all
        the medical questions. At least the ones we could fit into the (now
        slightly longer) loop.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Which was true for you?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Is life better, worse, or the same?
      </p>

      <p>
        When I go back three years and look forward <em>life is better</em>. I
        live in a new house (on the farm that Hilary always dreamed of having),
        the company I poured my heart and soul into is growing in a remarkable
        way, and emotionally I am in a much better place thanks to deliberate
        work and counseling.
      </p>

      <p>
        That leads to a feeling of gratitude for everything that has happened.
      </p>

      <p>
        While that’s true for me, it’s important to leave space for those who
        may have a different experience. Life could be worse now than a few
        years ago. The loss of a loved one, a failed business, financial
        hardship, depression, or a host of other factors may mean that you wish
        things could get back to how they were before. My wish for you is that
        you are able to find hope that since it was once better, with
        <strong>deliberate work</strong>, life can return to that point.
      </p>

      <p>
        The final option is that everything might feel the same. Humans are
        designed to change and grow. Stagnation can feel depressing or even
        crippling. If that’s you, find one small thing to change. That could be
        the gym once a week, reading a new book, or learning a new skill.
        <strong>
          Don’t try to change everything at once. Start small, stay consistent,
          and see where it takes you.</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether reflection sparks gratitude, hope, or motivation, it’s always
        helpful to look back on your journey.
      </p>

      <h2>
        A full recovery
      </h2>

      <p>
        Throughout the day Ben was able to remember more and more. After a CT
        scan and more monitoring at the hospital he ended up making a full
        recovery. Though it was a few weeks before he went back to work, he did
        regain all of his memory, except for up until a few minutes before the
        Frisbee tournament started.
      </p>

      <p>
        What started as a frightening accident turned into an opportunity to
        look in from the outside—without the context and small steps of time
        marching forward—to gain a completely fresh perspective.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me that perspective points to a place of gratitude.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me that perspective points to a place of patience and gratitude. And
        I am sure only the patient and the grateful will benefit from this
        story. Someone may ask, what is patience and gratitude so that I may be
        patient and grateful.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Patience is of three categories:
      </h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Show patience towards the obligations of the Creator</li>
        <li>Show patience towards the prohibitions of the Creator</li>
        <li>
          Show patience towards the Decrees of the Creator that may bring you
          pain. eg like Ben's case
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>
        Gratitude is of three categories:
      </h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Gratitude of the heart (You show to the Creator that, I believe the
          favor is from you, nobody else)
        </li>
        <li>
          Gratitude of the Tongue (you are always speaking about the favors of
          the Creator, not your talents (humble))
        </li>
        <li>
          Gratitude of the Limbs (so that you only use your body, your private
          parts, your hands, your eyes, your ears, your senses, etc in that
          which please the Creator).
        </li>
      </ol>
